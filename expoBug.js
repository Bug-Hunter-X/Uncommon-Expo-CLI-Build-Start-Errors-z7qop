This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json`.  For instance, you might be using an older Expo CLI version that doesn't support a newer React Native or Expo SDK version used in your project.  Another possibility is incorrect configuration of your project's `app.json` or `expo.json` file, causing the CLI to fail to properly build or start your app. Incorrectly installed or conflicting packages can also trigger this error.
