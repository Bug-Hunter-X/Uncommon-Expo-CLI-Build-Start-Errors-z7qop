The solution depends on the root cause. If it's a version mismatch, update the Expo CLI using `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` and then update your project's dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn`). If the problem stems from `app.json` or `expo.json` configuration, carefully review the documentation for your Expo SDK version and correct any syntax or property errors. Double-check your package.json for any conflicting packages, and try deleting the node_modules directory and reinstalling the dependencies.  If you are still experiencing the error, provide the full error message and your project configuration for further assistance.
